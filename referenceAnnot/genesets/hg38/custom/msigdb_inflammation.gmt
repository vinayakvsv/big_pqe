GO_ACUTE_INFLAMMATORY_RESPONSE	> Inflammation which comprises a rapid, short-lived, relatively uniform response to acute injury or antigenic challenge and is characterized by accumulations of fluid, plasma proteins, and granulocytic leukocytes. An acute inflammatory response occurs within a matter of minutes or hours, and either resolves within a few days or becomes a chronic inflammatory response.

GO_CELLULAR_RESPONSE_TO_CORTICOSTEROID_STIMULUS	> Any process that results in a change in state or activity of a cell (in terms of movement, secretion, enzyme production, gene expression, etc.) as a result of a corticosteroid hormone stimulus. A corticosteroid is a steroid hormone that is produced in the adrenal cortex. Corticosteroids are involved in a wide range of physiologic systems such as stress response, immune response and regulation of inflammation, carbohydrate metabolism, protein catabolism, blood electrolyte levels, and behavior. They include glucocorticoids and mineralocorticoids.

GO_CHRONIC_INFLAMMATORY_RESPONSE	> Inflammation of prolonged duration (weeks or months) in which active inflammation, tissue destruction, and attempts at repair are proceeding simultaneously. Although it may follow acute inflammation, chronic inflammation frequently begins insidiously, as a low-grade, smoldering, often asymptomatic response.

GO_GRANULOCYTE_DIFFERENTIATION	> The process in which a myeloid precursor cell acquires the specialized features of a granulocyte. Granulocytes are a class of leukocytes characterized by the presence of granules in their cytoplasm. These cells are active in allergic immune reactions such as arthritic inflammation and rashes. This class includes basophils, eosinophils and neutrophils.	CBFA2T3	CEBPA	CSF3	GATA1	GATA2	IL25	JAGN1	KDM1A	L3MBTL3	LEF1	NKAP	SP3	SPI1	TAL1	ZFPM1
